        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            I developed this recipe when I had an abundance of zucchini and
            wanted a muffin to have with a chicken dinner. These savory muffins
            are great as a quick breakfast too! They're a hit even with those
            who think they don't like zucchini!
        </p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 ¾ cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 ½ teaspoons baking powder</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>¼ cup butter, melted</li>
            <li>1 egg, lightly beaten</li>
            <li>1 cup milk</li>
            <li>1 cup shredded unpeeled zucchini</li>
            <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
            <li>¾ cup shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
            <li>¼ cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese</li>
            <li>4 slices bacon, cooked crisp and crumbled</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray 12 muffin
                cups with cooking spray.
            </li>
            <li>
                Mix the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a bowl.
            </li>
            <li>
                In another bowl, stir together the butter, egg, milk, zucchini,
                and garlic until well blended. Mix the flour mixture into the
                milk mixture, about 1/2 cup at a time, stirring between
                additions, until the flour mixture is incorporated. Fold in the
                Cheddar cheese, Parmesan cheese, and crumbled bacon, and pour
                the batter into the prepared muffin cups.
            </li>
            <li>
                Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the
                center of a muffin comes out clean, 30 to 35 minutes. Allow
                muffins to cool slightly before removing from muffin cups; serve
                warm. Refrigerate leftovers.
            </li>
        </ol>
